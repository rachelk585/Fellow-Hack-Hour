/* 
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common 
ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest 
common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the 
lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where 
we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
      6
    /  \
  2      8
 / \    / \
0  4   7   9
   /\
  3 5
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
      6
    /  \
  2      8
 / \    / \
0  4   7   9
   /\
  3 5
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
  2
 /
1
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
 
Constraints:
[] The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
[] -109 <= Node.val <= 109
[] All Node.val are unique.
[] p != q
[] p and q will exist in the BST. */
